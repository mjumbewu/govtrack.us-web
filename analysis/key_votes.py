# Find all "key votes" in a Congress, which are votes that have a lot of statistical outliers.
# Write a CSV file listing the outliers of each vote so we can quickly determine what votes
# a MoC is an outlier or not an outlier in.
#
# (i.e. votes that are completely predictable are not interesting/informative for users trying
# to learn about their rep's record)
